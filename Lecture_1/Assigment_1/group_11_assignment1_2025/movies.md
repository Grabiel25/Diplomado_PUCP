# GROUP 11
## 1.1 Explain the difference between working on a branch and working directly on main. Why is it recommended to always use branches in collaborative projects?
A branch is like a separate universe in our GitHub environment.
While the main branch is the primary timeline or the main universe, a new branch is a new universe created for making changes without affecting the main product. 
## 1.2 Create a branch 
Group eleven has created a branch called group_11_assignment1_2025.
We also have created a folder at the following path: r”..\GitHub\Diplomado_PUCP\Lecture_1\Assigment_1\group_11_assignment1_2025
This folder contains two documents for our assignment: a .md file and a .ipynb file.
